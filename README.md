# Wedding Website RSVP System

This project is a Wedding Reservation and RSVP system designed to streamline guest management for weddings. Guests can use an online RSVP form to confirm their attendance and specify the number of attendees per invite. Each submission is logged in real-time in a Google Sheets document, enabling the wedding organizers and couple to track and plan based on accurate guest counts.
Additionally, the system sends an email notification to the organizer whenever a new RSVP is submitted, including details such as the guestâ€™s name, contact information, and number of attendees. This feature keeps organizers updated without the need for manual tracking.

## Features
- **User-Friendly RSVP Form**: Allows guests to enter their name, contact information, and the number of attendees per invitation.
- **Real-Time Organizer Notifications**: Sends an automated email update to the wedding organizers each time an RSVP is submitted, keeping them informed.
- **Centralized Guest Management**: Utilizes Google Sheets to capture and store RSVP details, simplifying the event planning process.
- **Wedding Details Display**: Provides guests with essential wedding information, such as date, location, and time.
- **Pin Wedding Venue Location on Google Maps**: Displays the wedding venue's location on Google Maps, allowing guests to easily find directions.
