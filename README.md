Wedding website RSVP system

I created a Wedding Reservation system, which can be sent out to guests in order for them to rsvp and also capture the amount guests expected per invite. The wedding organisers and couple are able plan based on the feedback from guests, that they receive via email and Google spreadsheet.

The project makes use of a HTML, CSS, Javascript and Google Sheets. The system makes use of Google Sheets to store the guest information, HTML/CSS for creating a user friendly interface.

Description of the Project

Storing guest details of the users, like their email address, contact number and the number of guests that will attend wedding per invite sent.
Provide the guests with details such as the date and locaton of the wedding.
